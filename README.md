My first Machine Learning project built with my friend [Vaibhav](https://github.com/vaibhav410) for college project, where we developed a Deep Learning-based Road Sign Detection system. 


🚦 **Road Sign Detection using Deep Learning**


## 📌 **Project Overview**


This project focuses on detecting and classifying road signs from images using deep learning.
The goal is to assist self-driving cars in understanding road environments by recognizing traffic signals, speed limits, and other signs.


## 🛠️ **Features**


Real-time road sign detection.

Bounding Box labeled objects with confidence.

Supports classification of multiple road sign categories.


## **Implementation**


The implementation of the Object Detection project was carried out in a systematic manner, beginning with dataset preparation and ending with real-time detection results. The entire workflow was executed in Google Colab using GPU acceleration for efficient training and testing.


### 1. **Dataset Integration**

•	The dataset was created and managed using Roboflow, which allowed image uploading, annotation, and preprocessing.

•	Each image was annotated with bounding boxes marking the location of objects.

•	The final dataset was exported in YOLO-compatible format (with training, validation, and test splits).

•	The dataset was then imported into the Colab environment for model training.


### 2. **Environment Setup**
 
•	In Google Colab, the required dependencies were installed, including:

o	Ultralytics (for YOLOv8 framework)

o	Pandas (for data handling and analysis)

o	Roboflow API (for dataset access and integration)

•	GPU runtime was enabled to accelerate training.

•	Project directories were created for organizing datasets, model weights, and results.


### 3. **Model Training**
 
•	The YOLOv8 model from Ultralytics was selected due to its high speed and accuracy.

•	Pre-trained YOLOv8 weights were used and fine-tuned on the custom dataset (transfer learning).

•	Training parameters:

o	Epochs: Defined number of iterations for learning.

o	Batch size: Optimized for available GPU memory.

o	Learning rate: Tuned for stable convergence.


### 4. **Model Validation**
 
•	After training, the model was validated on a separate test dataset.

•	Key metrics were measured, including:

o	Precision: How many predicted objects were correct.

o	Recall: How many actual objects were detected.

o	mAP (mean Average Precision): Overall detection performance.

•	The validation process helped evaluate how well the model generalized to unseen images.


### 5. **Inference and Output**
 
•	The trained YOLOv8 model was used for inference on new test images.

•	Each detected object was marked with a bounding box, label, and confidence score.

•	Results showed that the model successfully detected multiple objects simultaneously and delivered accurate predictions.

•	The outputs demonstrated the system’s ability to be applied in real-world scenarios such as surveillance, product detection, and automation tasks.
